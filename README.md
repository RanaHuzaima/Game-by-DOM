# Bubble Game-by-DOM

🚀 Just wrapped up a productive morning! From 10:30 AM to 06:00 PM, Today I made this **Bubble Game By DOM** and also **Responsive Check Out**

💡 I've learned so much about manipulating HTML and CSS elements dynamically, updating content in real-time, and creating interactive web applications. The DOM truly is the backbone of modern web development!

🤓 Feeling accomplished and ready to tackle more JavaScript challenges. 💪🏽 Stay tuned for more coding adventures! 📚👩‍💻
